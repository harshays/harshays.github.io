## What I might blog about

*June 4, 2019*

Hello world! This blog serves two purposes. It primarily functions as a collection of expository notes on topics and papers in machine learning that I find interesting or useful. I also want to use it as a medium to share my research to a wider audience in an accessible manner. I plan to update the blog on a monthly or bi-monthly basis. Excited to see how this pans out!
