## Why blog?

*June 4, 2019*

Hello world! I've decided to start blogging for two reasons. First, the blog allows me to share my work with the general research community in an accessible manner. Second, it also functions as a collection of expository notes on topics in machine learning and related areas that I find interesting or useful. I plan to update the blog on a monthly or bi-monthly basis. Excited to see how this pans out!
